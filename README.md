Repo containing data and relevant processing software for the broadband seismometer data project for the Colorado School of Mines Geophysics Field Camp. /

This project aims to analyze broadband seismometer data collected by Mines field camp teams in the Steamboat Springs area from 2022, 2023, and 2024, as well as data from Colorado Geological Survey broadband instruments deployed nearby over that time period. Our data consists mainly of miniseed files with data for the traces we collected. Our software aims to process these traces and identify local-scale earthquakes that occurred over the course of the deployment to better understand tectonic activity in the area.
